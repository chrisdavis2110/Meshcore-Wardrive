# Changelog

All notable changes to MeshCore Wardrive will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed repeater ID detection to correctly identify responding repeaters**
  - App now properly parses mesh network routing paths to extract actual repeater that echoed ping
  - Coverage squares and sample markers now display accurate repeater IDs
  - Fixes issue where incorrect node IDs were being recorded in wardrive data
  - Improves accuracy of repeater tracking and coverage mapping

### Technical
- Enhanced path parsing logic to identify correct repeater from mesh routing information
- Repeater ID extraction now validates against actual network topology
- Sample data now contains accurate repeater attribution for coverage analysis

## [1.0.13] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **"Show GPS Samples" toggle in settings**
  - Toggle to show/hide blue GPS-only sample markers
  - Helps declutter map when you only want to see ping results
  - Located in Settings → Show GPS Samples
  - Subtitle explains "Show blue GPS-only markers"

### Technical
- Added SwitchListTile for GPS samples toggle in settings dialog
- Existing filter logic in `_buildSampleLayer()` now accessible via UI
- GPS-only samples (null pingSuccess) can be hidden with one tap

## [1.0.12] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed sample data overwriting bug**
  - Sample IDs now use timestamp + random number instead of timestamp + geohash
  - Prevents samples at same location from having identical IDs and overwriting each other
  - Database changed from REPLACE to IGNORE conflict algorithm to accumulate all samples
  - Fixes issue where uploaded data appeared to replace existing webmap data
- **Fixed coverage display showing floating point errors**
  - Weighted values now rounded to 1 decimal place (1.2 instead of 1.2000000000000002)
  - Received/Lost values on separate lines to prevent text overflow
- **Map now centers on user's location on startup**
  - Fixes issue where map always loaded at Seattle/default location
  - Map automatically moves to GPS position when app opens

### Added
- **Color-coded sample markers**
  - Green dots = Successful pings
  - Red dots = Failed pings
  - Blue dots = GPS-only samples (no ping attempt)
  - Makes it easy to visually identify coverage at a glance

### Technical
- Added `_generateUniqueId()` function with random component
- Changed `ConflictAlgorithm.replace` to `ConflictAlgorithm.ignore` in database
- Added `_showGpsSamples` toggle for future GPS sample filtering
- Coverage info dialog uses `toStringAsFixed(1)` and Flexible widgets
- Map controller automatically moves to user position after `getCurrentLocation()`

## [1.0.11] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Clickable Sample Markers** - Tap any sample dot on the map to view details
  - Shows ping status (Success/Failed/GPS Only)
  - Displays timestamp when sample was collected
  - Shows latitude/longitude coordinates
  - Displays repeater ID that heard the ping
  - Shows RSSI (signal strength) and SNR (signal quality) values
  - Matches webmap functionality with additional signal metrics

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed RSSI/SNR values showing as null in ping results**
  - 0x88 frames are raw radio log frames (PUSH_CODE_LOG_RX_DATA), not channel echoes
  - SNR and RSSI now correctly extracted from bytes 0-1 of frame payload
  - SNR value automatically descaled from firmware's 4x multiplier
  - RSSI properly converted from signed byte value
  - Ping results now show accurate signal strength and quality metrics

### Technical
- Added `parseRawLogFrame()` function to handle 0x88 frame format: [SNR][RSSI][raw_packet...]
- Modified frame handler to use new parser instead of `parseChannelMessageFrame()` for 0x88
- SNR extracted from byte 0, divided by 4 to get actual value
- RSSI extracted from byte 1, converted from unsigned to signed byte
- Parser also extracts sender/repeater info from raw packet data when available
- Added `_showSampleInfo()` dialog with GestureDetector on sample markers
- Sample markers expanded to 16x16px tap targets with 8x8px visible circles

## [1.0.10] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Configurable Coverage Resolution** - Dynamically adjust coverage square size
  - 5 precision levels: Regional (~20km), City (~5km), Neighborhood (~1.2km), Street (~153m), Building (~38m)
  - Samples stored at high precision (38m), re-aggregated on-the-fly based on user preference
  - Accessible via Settings → Coverage Resolution
  - Allows drivers to see regional trends and walkers to map precise street-level coverage
- **Smart Sample Weighting System** - Intelligently handles conflicting coverage data
  - Newer samples receive higher weight than older samples
  - Old samples contradicted by 2+ newer samples are heavily discounted (10% weight)
  - Samples that agree with newer data maintain full weight
  - Time-based decay: Fresh (100%), 1-day (80%), 1-week (50%), 30+ days (20%)
  - Dead zones can become green if new data shows coverage, and vice versa

### Changed
- Coverage model now uses weighted fractional counts (double) instead of integer counts
- Aggregation service groups samples by coverage area before processing
- Success rate calculations now factor in sample age and contradictions

### Technical
- Modified `GeohashUtils.coverageKey()` to accept precision parameter (4-8)
- Updated `AggregationService.buildIndexes()` with coveragePrecision parameter
- Coverage.received and Coverage.lost changed from int to double
- Added contradiction detection algorithm comparing samples in same coverage area

## [1.0.9] - 2026-01-11

  - Toggle on/off with GPS button (above play/stop button)
  - Shows `gps_fixed` icon (blue background) when active
  - Shows `gps_not_fixed` icon (gray) when inactive
  - Automatically disables when you manually pan/drag the map
  - Toast notifications show when enabled/disabled

### Technical
- Added `_followLocation` state variable
- Map controller automatically moves to GPS position on location updates when enabled
- `onMapEvent` handler detects manual map panning and disables auto-follow
- Replaced `my_location` button with toggle-able GPS follow button
