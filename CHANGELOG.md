# Changelog

All notable changes to MeshCore Wardrive will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Configurable Coverage Resolution** - Dynamically adjust coverage square size
  - 5 precision levels: Regional (~20km), City (~5km), Neighborhood (~1.2km), Street (~153m), Building (~38m)
  - Samples stored at high precision (38m), re-aggregated on-the-fly based on user preference
  - Accessible via Settings → Coverage Resolution
  - Allows drivers to see regional trends and walkers to map precise street-level coverage
- **Smart Sample Weighting System** - Intelligently handles conflicting coverage data
  - Newer samples receive higher weight than older samples
  - Old samples contradicted by 2+ newer samples are heavily discounted (10% weight)
  - Samples that agree with newer data maintain full weight
  - Time-based decay: Fresh (100%), 1-day (80%), 1-week (50%), 30+ days (20%)
  - Dead zones can become green if new data shows coverage, and vice versa

### Changed
- Coverage model now uses weighted fractional counts (double) instead of integer counts
- Aggregation service groups samples by coverage area before processing
- Success rate calculations now factor in sample age and contradictions

### Technical
- Modified `GeohashUtils.coverageKey()` to accept precision parameter (4-8)
- Updated `AggregationService.buildIndexes()` with coveragePrecision parameter
- Coverage.received and Coverage.lost changed from int to double
- Added contradiction detection algorithm comparing samples in same coverage area

## [1.0.9] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Auto-follow GPS location button** - Map automatically centers and follows your position
  - Toggle on/off with GPS button (above play/stop button)
  - Shows `gps_fixed` icon (blue background) when active
  - Shows `gps_not_fixed` icon (gray) when inactive
  - Automatically disables when you manually pan/drag the map
  - Toast notifications show when enabled/disabled

### Technical
- Added `_followLocation` state variable
- Map controller automatically moves to GPS position on location updates when enabled
- `onMapEvent` handler detects manual map panning and disables auto-follow
- Replaced `my_location` button with toggle-able GPS follow button

## [1.0.8] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Removed Seattle-area geofence that was blocking auto-ping for all users outside 60-mile radius**
  - Auto-ping now works globally, anywhere on Earth
  - Fixes issue where auto-ping appeared enabled but never triggered for users outside Seattle area
  - This was the root cause of Samsung Galaxy Fold 6/7 users reporting non-functioning auto-ping

### Technical
- Removed hardcoded distance check from `GeohashUtils.isValidLocation()`
- Location validation now only checks basic latitude/longitude bounds (-90 to 90, -180 to 180)
- App now supports worldwide coverage collection

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- Clickable coverage squares showing detailed information
- Coverage info popup displays:
  - Total samples collected in square
  - Success rate percentage
  - Received vs lost ping counts
  - Number of repeaters heard
  - Repeater ID prefixes (first 2 characters)
- Same information as webmap coverage squares
- Draggable scrollable settings menu (swipe up/down)

### Fixed
- Settings menu no longer overlaps top bar or navigation buttons
- Repeater IDs now properly tracked from actual ping responses
- Coverage squares show IDs of repeaters that actually echoed pings

### Technical
- Added invisible tap markers at coverage square centers
- Implemented coverage info dialog matching webmap functionality
- Track repeater IDs from sample.path (node that echoed)
- Wrapped settings in DraggableScrollableSheet with SafeArea

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-10

### Changed
- Reduced ping timeout from 30 seconds to 20 seconds for faster response detection
- Improved ping reliability matching MeshCore app behavior

### Technical
- Optimized ping wait time to match typical mesh network response times

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Coverage squares now populate correctly when auto-ping is enabled
- Fixed duplicate GPS sample saving that was preventing coverage squares from showing
- When auto-ping is active, only the ping result is saved (not the intermediate GPS sample)

### Technical
- Removed redundant sample saving in location_service.dart when auto-ping triggers
- GPS samples are now only saved when auto-ping is disabled or between ping intervals

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-09

### Changed
- Increased map zoom out range from level 8 to level 3
- Allows viewing entire regions and multiple states at once

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- Auto-ping visual feedback with orange pulse animation on map
- Persistent notification updates during auto-ping:
  - Shows "Pinging..." when ping starts
  - Shows "✅ Heard by [node]" on success
  - Shows "❌ No response" on failure
  - Returns to "Location tracking active" after 3 seconds
- Check for Updates feature in settings
  - Queries GitHub API for latest release
  - Shows update available dialog when new version exists
  - Direct download link to GitHub releases
- View on GitHub link in settings
- "About" section in settings menu
- Increased map zoom out range (minZoom: 3.0) for better overview

### Technical
- Added `url_launcher` package for opening external links
- Implemented ping event stream for real-time UI feedback
- Added foreground service notification updates

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-09

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Background GPS tracking now works reliably on modern Android devices (Pixel 8, Samsung S24, etc.)
- Map updates in real-time during tracking instead of waiting up to 5 seconds
- Auto-ping no longer blocks location updates - tracking continues smoothly while pings are in progress
- Debug terminal now automatically scrolls to latest logs when opened
- Web map repeater display now only shows when pings were actually received
- Filtered out "Unknown" nodes from web map repeater lists (no more "UN" prefix)
